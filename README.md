Why did you decide to learn data science? 
    I graduated high school in June 2022 and got accepeted to City College of New York. I decided to explore my options and did more intensive research. I was looking particullary into the data science field. This is because I met a data scientist and he explained what he does. I really enjoyed what he said and looked into it more until I decided to learn this full time. 
Past career or educational experience:
    I had my digital marketing business which I was advertising for businesses, specifically small local businesses. This business was launched October 2020 when almost all businesses were suffering due to covid. 
How I learned about Data Science?
    I took a basic stastics class in high school and had some interest in that field. I spoke to my teacher about the potential fields I may be interested in and she said data science was one of them. 

How I chose Flatiron:
    I chose Flatiron because after I did my research, Flatiron was the most reputable bootcamp I came across. 

What I am hoping to do with Flatiron in the future:
    I am hoping to use the skills I delevop from Flatiron to work as a data scientist.
